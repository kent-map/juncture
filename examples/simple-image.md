# Indigo: Fading and Staining Throughout History

### Indigo: Fading into the Background
Upon first glance, the <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="2301,3670,1536,1242">background</span> of Johannes Vermeer’s _Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (c. 1665) appears black, especially when viewed against the light blue of the subject’s turban. However, thanks to the passage of four centuries, the original indigo pigment used to paint the background has faded, rendering its significance hardly noticeable to a modern audience more fixated on matters such as the subject's identity. The worldwide popularity and widespread use of indigo make this ignorance doubly visible. The pigment itself is not the only aspect of the painting that has faded: the often violent and exploitative context in which indigo was obtained and used during the colonial period has been largely overlooked for a dye whose widespread popularity has endured for millennia. For the purposes of this painting, it was exported from the Americas to the Netherlands, and therefore was most likely produced using enslaved labor.[^1] This is one of the many examples of indigo’s inextricable linkage with a dark colonial past. The indigo plant certainly carries a diverse history often associated with colonialism and the exploitation of labor. When paid greater attention, however, this history reveals overlooked art forms that contribute to a reframing of knowledge that reaches beyond its violent past.

More than 750 species belong to the _Indigofera L._ genus, and its native range spans Africa, Asia, the Southwest Pacific, Central and Southern U.S., and the tropics.[^1] The genus belongs to the bean family, and as a legume, Indigo “can fix nitrogen in the soil, and therefore, it’s used as a rotation crop in agriculture to improve soil quality.”[^2] Perhaps its most well known of its species is _Indigofera tinctoria_, which, otherwise known as “true indigo,”  is the dominant species in the Indian subcontinent.[^3] Another popular indigo species is _Indigo suffruticosa_, which is dominant in Central and South America.[^4] While many indigo plants produce beautiful flowers of blue or pink, its dye comes from its distinctive round leaves. Once these leaves are harvested, the blue dye is made through a process of <span eid="Q41760">fermentation</span>. Leaves are “soaked in water and churned until they release a navy blue froth,” which is then filtered for impurities and turned into a powder or paste.[^5] In most cases, this powder or paste is then used to create pigment for paint and a dye for clothing and textiles.
