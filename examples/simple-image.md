# Indigo: Fading and Staining Throughout History

### Indigo: Fading into the Background
Upon first glance, the <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="2301,3670,1536,1242">background</span> of Johannes Vermeer’s _Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (c. 1665) appears black, especially when viewed against the light blue of the subject’s turban. However, thanks to the passage of four centuries, the original indigo pigment used to paint the background has faded, rendering its significance hardly noticeable to a modern audience more fixated on matters such as the subject's identity. The worldwide popularity and widespread use of indigo make this ignorance doubly visible. The pigment itself is not the only aspect of the painting that has faded: the often violent and exploitative context in which indigo was obtained and used during the colonial period has been largely overlooked for a dye whose widespread popularity has endured for millennia. For the purposes of this painting, it was exported from the Americas to the Netherlands, and therefore was most likely produced using enslaved labor.[^1] This is one of the many examples of indigo’s inextricable linkage with a dark colonial past. The indigo plant certainly carries a diverse history often associated with colonialism and the exploitation of labor. When paid greater attention, however, this history reveals overlooked art forms that contribute to a reframing of knowledge that reaches beyond its violent past.

### Reclaiming Knowledge Through Art: SOMArts "Indigo Project" Exhibit
In 2022, the SOMArts Cultural Center in San Francisco debuted an exhibition called “The Indigo Project.” This exhibition, which included multidisciplinary works such as textiles, photographs, and dolls, aimed to highlight the connection between Black culture and the production of indigo-based art. Created by priestess Bushmama Africa and artist Isha Rosemond, the exhibition was meant to point to, in Africa’s words, “Africa before colonization,” in which “all the dynasties wore indigo and they had their own print that signified each dynasty.” Certainly, the location of the exhibition in America and its emphasis on precolonial Africa makes a connection between the two inevitable, and reminds viewers of indigo’s equal significance to enslavement in America. By locating indigo-based art across two continents with an interconnected history and legacy of slavery, “The Indigo Project” seeks not only to highlight the similarities, but also the differences between the two: indigo in Africa as entirely distinct from America in the precolonial era, and indigo in America as indebted to African artistic traditions.
