      <p class="">Quinoa had its big break in 2013, when the <span eid="Q119847893">Food and Agriculture
          Organization</span> of the United Nations (FAO) declared it the International Year of Quinoa, and a flurry of
        newspaper and scholarly articles talked about this new food. It seemed to appear out of nowhere, and it had
        wonderful nutritional properties—high protein, essential vitamins and minerals, gluten-free.<sup id="fnref:1"><a
            class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> For its exceptional nutrition and exoticism, people began
        calling quinoa a “superfood,” an idea whose roots date back to <a
          href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/superfoods/">marketing campaigns for bananas in the early
          twentieth century</a>. For several years prior to FAO's announcement, and especially following 2013, consumers
        in the Global North began adding it to salads for a protein boost, substituting it for rice to eliminate carbs,
        and experimenting with it in baked goods. And yet, these new consumers hardly knew where it came from, the
        farmers who cultivated it, what quinoa meant to the farmers before the quinoa boom, and the impact of the food
        trend on these communities.

      <p class="">In fact, quinoa has a long history, dating back several thousand years to the Andean region of South
        America, where it was typically grown as a subsistence food by farmers in what is today Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador,
        Chile, and Argentina. The quinoa boom has brought new opportunities and challenges to the Andes, making the
        situation a complex interplay between local farmers, state policies, and international consumer preferences. The
        anthropologist Emma McDonnell argues that quinoa has become a “miracle crop,” a plant that various groups think
        can solve myriad problems, but the realities regarding quinoa have been much more tempered than the lofty
        aspirations of some promoters.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Plants are
        crucial to our diets, and yet we rarely think about how the nutritional interests of one country can impact the
        nutritional interests of another far away. Understanding how quinoa transformed from an isolated Andean
        subsistence crop to an international “superfood” is important when considering issues of food justice,
        sustainability, and the next food trend or diet fad that mythologizes a "forgotten" plant like quinoa.

        <p class="">The word quinoa comes from Quechua, an Indigenous language family spoken in the Andes. Quinoa is in
          the genus <em>Chenopodium</em> or the goosefoot family, so-called because the leaves resemble the
          three-pointed feet of a goose. Of the nearly 250 species in the <em>Chenopodium</em> family, quinoa is the
          most well-known. Closely related species include lamb's quarters (<em>Chenopodium album</em>), a common
          species of the same genus found around the world and widely considered a weed, and amaranth and spinach, in
          the same wider family (<em>Amaranthaceae</em>).

          which it was central to its culture and cuisine is unclear. The Inca also referred to quinoa as chisiya mama,

        <p class="">Archaeological evidence suggests that quinoa was likely first domesticated more than 5,000 years ago

          have concluded that camelids would eat the wild species of quinoa, release the seeds in their droppings near
          herding communities, and wild quinoa seeds would sprout nearby. Over time, ancient Andeans would come to
          formally cultivate quinoa. It is this relationship between camelids, quinoa, and people that allowed quinoa to
          be domesticated thousands of years ago.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>

      <div data-id="2.1" id="2.1" class="segment">
        <p class="">Spanish colonization in the sixteenth century brought significant changes to farmers growing quinoa.
          As part of the Columbian Exchange, the Spaniards brought wheat, barley, rice, and other crops from the Old
          World and introduced them to Andean farming systems. Early colonial policies made Indigenous people pay a
          tribute tax, which could only be paid in wheat or barley. As the geographer Karl Zimmerer explains, this
          policy essentially forced farmers to grow less quinoa and more European crops. Nevertheless, despite the

        <p class="">In an illustrated chronicle written in 1615 in the form of a letter to the king of Spain, the
          Indigenous nobleman <span eid="Q473217">Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala</span> explained the agricultural habits
          of Indigenous Andeans. Alongside quinoa, they grew potatoes, oca (a tuber), maize, coca, and many other
          plants. Guaman Poma explained that in September, farmers planted quinoa. While the Inca did not have a writing
          system, they devised a way to maintain important records on knotted threads called a <span

          how to read quipus, it is likely that they served more as a recording device than a formal writing system.
          Guaman Poma explained that “[The Royal Accountant] kept track of the amount of wool of the deer called
          <em>taruca</em>, that of the Indians, and the food called quinoa. He counted the quinoa and the Indians. He
          was very capable, as if he used paper and ink.”<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref"

          among a wide variety of cultivated tubers, grains, and other plants.

          explorers and chroniclers of the Andes were fascinated by quinoa, but it took much longer for quinoa to become
          popular outside the Andes compared to other plants. Garcilaso explained that both Indigenous people and

        <p class="">Whether the Spanish enjoyed quinoa as much as Garcilaso suggests is not entirely clear. For one, the
          tribute policy and the continual decline in quinoa production throughout the colonial period suggest that the
          Spanish did not quite so appreciate quinoa. Sometimes called the first “mestizo”—a person of mixed Indigenous
          and Spanish descent—Garcilaso sought to defend racial mixing at a time when Spaniards marginalized mestizos.
          His excellent early account of Indigenous customs, including quinoa consumption, describes how Indigenous
          people made quinoa into a beverage, brewing it along with maize into a beer known as chicha. Today, chicha
          remains an important part of Andean societies, although it is most often made exclusively with corn. During
          ceremonies, and before taking a sip, attendees spill several drops of chicha onto the ground as an offering to
          Pachamama, a deity in Indigenous Andean cosmologies that is similar to the idea of "Mother Earth."<sup

      <h3 class="">Early Descriptions of Quinoa</h3>

      <div data-id="3.1" id="3.1" class="segment">
        <p class="">As European crops entered the New World, Europeans quickly introduced plants from the Americas to
          the Old World. Overall, the Spanish were skeptical of New World cuisine. Now ubiquitous foods like corn,
          chocolate, chilies, and potatoes once caused great hesitation and rejection among conquistadors due to racist
          perceptions of Indigenous people. Because maize was so important to Indigenous diets throughout the Americas,
          Spaniards analogized the crop to wheat. As the food historian Rebecca Earle explains, church officials debated
          the extent to which wheat and corn were the same. For the Catholic ritual of communion, Europeans would always
          use wheat, but Spaniards debated whether maize could be used instead in the colonies. Ultimately, they
          determined that maize was not a suitable replacement, and as Earle describes, corn became a sort of
          “anti-wheat.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup> Analogies also applied to
          New World animals. Initially, llamas and alpacas, cornerstones of Andean cultures and foodways, were likened
          to sheep. Europeans used terms like “Peruvian sheep” or “Indian sheep” despite quite different physical
          features, behaviors, and Indigenous husbandry practices.<sup id="fnref:17"><a class="footnote-ref"

        <p class="">Quinoa was not immune to these sorts of colonial prejudices and analogies. Garcilaso de la Vega made
          quinoa understandable to European readers by comparing it to rice or millet because of their comparable size
          and shape. Questionable comparisons lingered well into the nineteenth century. In 1839, an article in
          <em>Curtis’s Botanical Magazine</em>, a prominent English garden and botanical magazine, said quinoa is “like
          the Corn in Europe, the ‘chief nourishment of the people.’” The magazine was exaggerating; quinoa was
          certainly important, but potatoes would have been, and still are, the centerpiece of Andean diets. Making
          another dubious comparison, the article stated that after boiling quinoa like rice or oatmeal, “the seeds are
          described as floating in the liquid coiled up and looking like little white worms.”<sup id="fnref:18"><a

      <div data-id="4.1" id="4.1" class="segment">
        <p class="">Since the recent rise in international interest in quinoa, scholars in a variety of disciplines have
          begun to study more closely its scientific properties, politics, economics, and cultural importance. Quinoa
          serves as a case study to understand the possibilities and limitations of Western and Andean traditions. As
          the anthropologist Linda Seligmann writes, “The story of quinoa highlights points of incommensurability in the
          Andes between Indigenous and western perspectives, especially around politics, land, and social relationships,
          but also shows how problematic it is to romanticize Indigenous ontologies and epistemologies.”<sup
            id="fnref:19"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> As a result, quinoa has become a useful
          plant to conceive of new global relationships to food, crops, and natural resources and the potential
          challenges of doing so.

        <p class="">Scientists and international development agencies, such as the FAO, have hailed quinoa as an
          important crop to alleviate the challenges of global hunger and maintaining world’s food supply exacerbated by
          climate change and a narrowing of crop diversity. Wheat, rice, and corn make up two-thirds of all calories
          consumed, and we rely on very few varieties of those crops. This means that pests, diseases, and unforeseen
          climate disasters could dramatically impact global public health if there is a major crop failure.<sup

        <p class="">Why does quinoa have so much potential? In short, because of its cultural, nutritional, and
          ecological characteristics. In an era of multiculturalism, crops with a long history and cultural significance
          among marginalized populations have become appealing to consumers and international policymakers. And in the
          context of globalization, fears of losing cultural traditions motivate efforts to preserve "traditional"
          knowledge and ways of living. One can see the results of this mindset in the slogan for the International Year
          of Quinoa: "A future sown thousands of years ago." Quinoa's success has made it "a poster child for
          multicultural development to integrate cultural difference" into a path toward economic growth.<sup

        <p class="">Quinoa is better nutritionally than many other grain crops, such as wheat, rice, or barley. The
          first chemical analysis to show this was performed in 1850. Augustus Voelcker, a chemist at the Royal
          Agricultural College in Cirencester, England, determined that quinoa contains 19 percent protein by mass—not
          far off from today’s estimates of 15 percent. It would take almost a century and a half, however, for quinoa’s
          nutritional facts to be widely appreciated.<sup id="fnref:23"><a class="footnote-ref"

          because it has almost twice as much compared to rice and slightly higher than wheat. The quality of the

        <p class="">Ecologically, quinoa can adapt to many types of growing environments because there are thousands of

          grocery store, it may seem that there are only three types: white, black, and red. But quinoa varieties differ
          more than by color, and can be classified into five broad categories based on geography: the coasts of Chile,
          the inter-Andean valley regions, the altiplano (high plateau) region that spans Peru and Bolivia, the Yungas
          (eastern slopes of the Andes), and the <span eid="Q76122">salt flats of Bolivia</span>. Each of these areas

      <div data-id="5.1" id="5.1" class="segment">
        <p class="">To arrive at the International Year of Quinoa, the plant rode several waves to international
          stardom. First, there was a growing interest in non-Western mysticism among American counterculture movements
          in the late twentieth century. Although there is no definitive history of how quinoa became so popular among
          American consumers, according to some accounts, this worldview was an impetus for introducing quinoa into
          health-food grocery stores in the 1980s.<sup id="fnref:26"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:26">26</a></sup>
          Second, diet trends like low-carb or gluten-free diets pushed eaters toward alternative grains, and quinoa,
          having no gluten and low amounts of carbohydrates, made it a good candidate for several food fads. Finally,
          quinoa became associated with fine dining thanks to a recent culinary movement in Peru called “novoandina”
          cuisine, which combines European fine dining aesthetics and tastes with traditional Andean ingredients.<sup
            id="fnref:27"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:27">27</a></sup> “Quinotto,” a risotto made from quinoa and
          created by Bernardo Roca Rey in the 1980s, is considered the dish that sparked the novoandina gastronomy
          movement that has since made Peruvian cuisine world famous.

        <p class="">Since the International Year of Quinoa, journalists and scholars have debated whether the quinoa
          boom has improved or exploited the lives of Indigenous quinoa farmers. Proponents argue that profits return to
          the communities, stimulating economic growth and reducing poverty. However, critics point out that Western
          consumption of quinoa is example of the economic exploitation of an important Indigenous resource that does
          not adequately compensate the communities that have cultivated it for centuries. Finding a middle ground
          between promoting sustainable development without harming the communities themselves, therefore, is no simple
          task.

        <p class="">One potential problem for quinoa growers in the Andes aside from cultural appropriation is the
          introduction of commercial quinoa farming in the United States, China, and elsewhere. These markets may be
          able to produce more quinoa at a lower price and outcompete Andean farmers. While this has not happened yet,
          it is not an entirely unfounded fear. In 1994, American researchers patented an improved variety of quinoa
          based on seeds cultivated by Bolivian farmers, and in response, the <a
            href="https://anapqui.org.bo/en/">National Association of Quinoa Producers (ANAPQUI)</a> in Bolivia fiercely
          challenged the patent, arguing that it stole intellectual property from the Indigenous farmers. The patent was
          upheld but the owners let it expire in 1998. Spurred by the memory of this event, the 2009 Bolivian
          constitution makes explicit that the state controls, monitors, and regulates biological and genetic
          resources.<sup id="fnref:28"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:28">28</a></sup> This may prevent international
          biopiracy, the unauthorized exploitation of biological knowledge or resources. But even the state-controlled
          solution is not perfect. As Emma McDonnell writes in the Peruvian context, “As indigenous farming communities
          lose control over quinoa’s genetic resources, they become consumers of seeds created in state and private
          laboratories and no longer are they the key decision-makers regarding quinoa [plant genetic resources].”<sup
